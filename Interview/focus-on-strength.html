		<h1>Interview tips: Focus on your strengths</h1>
		<h3>What are the key messages you're delivering in your job search campaign? Identify them by focusing on your best assets.</h3>
	<div class="container-fluid">
		<p>Want to wow a hiring manager in a job interview? Learning to focus&nbsp;on your strengths&mdash;the skills and talents that set you apart from other job candidates&mdash;is a smart strategy. Plus, the people who are interviewing you actually want you to do well and will give you every opportunity to put your best foot forward&mdash;that&#39;s why those strengths interview questions are popular.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I call them career superpowers,&rdquo; says Brenda Abdilla, a Denver-based career and leadership coach. &ldquo;Your strengths make you irresistible to an employer.&rdquo; Take these steps to identify&nbsp;your strong suits and learn how to communicate them clearly at a job interview.</p>

<h2><strong>Assess your career achievements</strong></h2>

<p>Before you can sell your strengths</a>, you need to pinpoint what they are. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s your job, as a job seeker, to figure out what your top skills are,&rdquo; says job search strategist Jenny Foss. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the job of the hiring manager or recruiter to make those deductions for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kathy Caprino, a Connecticut-based career coach and author of the book <em>The Most Powerful You: 7 Bravery-Boosting Paths to Career Bliss,</em> recommends job seekers do some self-reflection before they sit down for an audition. &ldquo;Think back on the last 10 wins&nbsp;you&rsquo;ve had at work,&rdquo; Caprino says. &ldquo;What helped you create those successes, specifically, and how did you do it in ways others may not have achieved in the same manner?&rdquo;</p>

<p>In addition, &ldquo;ask 10 of your favorite colleagues who think highly of you&mdash;from your past and current roles&mdash;to share what they think makes you stand out in your work and your abilities,&rdquo; Caprino suggests.</p>

<h2><strong>Utilize the job description</strong></h2>

<p>As you focus on your strengths, keep in mind the job requirements for the position</a>&nbsp;and see where there&#39;s overlap. This is a crucial step, Abdilla says. A good starting point? Hiring managers frequently frontload job descriptions with the most important responsibilities. A job description&rsquo;s skills section can also be a great reference point.</p>

<h2><strong>Speak confidently about your strengths&mdash;</strong><strong>without overselling yourself</strong></h2>

<p>Some job seekers shy away fromself-promotion</a>, but a strengths interview question&nbsp;requires&nbsp;you to sell yourself and explain why you&rsquo;re the best person for the job. &ldquo;You need to be able to talk confidently about the things your strengths and achievements,&rdquo; says Abdilla.</p>

<p>The caveat? &ldquo;There is a right way to speak powerfully and confidently about your strengths and accomplishments, and there is a wrong way,&rdquo; Caprino says. &ldquo;Avoid superlatives and just raving about yourself, like saying, &#39;I&rsquo;m the best!&#39;&nbsp;and instead, present the facts about what you offer and how that is helpful to others and different from what [other job candidates] may offer.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Use anecdotes to make your case</strong></h2>

<p>Many job candidates make the mistake of talking about their strengths without offering concrete examples</a> that show the value they bring, Abdilla laments. Therefore, preparing anecdotes, that you can recite concisely, is a must. (e.g., &ldquo;I&rsquo;m well versed in promoting brands on social media. At my previous job, I created a new Facebook marketing campaign that enabled us to engage with prospective customers. I also grew the company&rsquo;s presence on Twitter by gaining 100,000 followers over the course of five months.&rdquo;)</p>

<h2><strong>Highlight your strengths from the outset</strong></h2>

<p>The first interview question many hiring managers ask is, &quot;Tell me about yourself</a>.&rdquo; This is a great opportunity to talk up your strengths, says Carole Martin, job interview coach and author of <em>Boost Your Interview IQ</em>. Delivering a well-crafted elevator pitch can set a positive tone for the conversation. Practice what you&rsquo;re going to say so that you&rsquo;re not scrambling to find the right words.</p>

<h2><strong>Quantify your achievements</strong></h2>

<p>Metrics sell, Foss says, so use >numbers to back up your accomplishments</a> and your core strengths&nbsp;whenever possible. There are obvious metrics like sales volume, market share and profitability, but there are also people-oriented numbers like clients served or employees managed that can help you describe your skills. Numbers should also be woven into your resume.</p>

<h2><strong>Fortify your job search</strong></h2>

<div>Now that you know how to put your best self forward when asked&nbsp;strengths interview questions, it&#39;s time to start getting called in. Step one begins with getting the attention of hiring managers.

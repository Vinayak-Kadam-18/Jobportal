		<h1>How to answer the job interview question: ‘What is your ideal company?’</h1>
        <h3>Hint: Give an answer that aligns your ideal workplace with the employer you’re talking to.</h3>
    	<div class="container-fluid">
<p>When a job interviewer asks, &ldquo;What is your ideal company?&rdquo; you may think to yourself, &ldquo;Hmm, one that pays six figures, offers unlimited vacation</a>, and has a four-day workweek</a>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But while that may be your fantasy, you need to remember that the hiring manager is looking for an answer that&rsquo;s more grounded in reality.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are interested in finding a match for the position and the company,&rdquo; says Michele Jennae, executive career coach and owner of Perpetual Career Management in Sacramento, California. &ldquo;A match doesn&rsquo;t just consist of qualifications, but motivation, attitude, potential, culture, and more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These suggestions can help you find a way to describe your ideal company and provide an answer that will impress your interviewer.</p>

<h2><strong>Be sincere</strong></h2>

<p>To avoid giving a canned, predictable response, you need to know what you really want in a workplace&mdash;and understand that isn&rsquo;t the same as what others may want.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Think about what an ideal company really does look like for you,&rdquo; says John J. Brady, executive director of Protem Partners in Philadelphia. &ldquo;When you know what it looks like, you can answer truthfully, which will also come across more convincingly.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>

<p>You need to have a clear idea of the type of environment that enables you to do your best work, says Marilyn Santiesteban, assistant director of career services at the Bush School of Government &amp; Public Service at Texas A&amp;M University. &ldquo;Do you work best in a collaborative team, or is a solo practitioner more your style? Do you like fast-paced, innovative environments or more hierarchical if-it-isn&#39;t-broke-don&rsquo;t-fix-it ones? Be clear about how these elements enable your top performance.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong><em>You say</em></strong><em>: &ldquo;My ideal company is one that values individual employees and encourages them to speak up and share ideas, but that also has a commitment to sustainability&rdquo; </em></p>

<h2><strong>Demonstrate alignment</strong></h2>

<p>Giving an answer based on how your own values overlap with the company&rsquo;s values is key to positioning yourself well, Jennae says. And here&rsquo;s where doing your homework on the company</a> pays off. &nbsp;&ldquo;Use a specific value or two that resonated with you and provide direct evidence as to why it represents your ideal,&rdquo; she says. This shows both alignment and preparation.</p>

<p><strong><em>You say</em></strong><em>: &ldquo;I know sustainability is part of your mission and something you consider in every project the company undertakes.&rdquo; </em></p>

<h2><strong>Focus on what you can offer</strong></h2>

<p>Your ideal company should help make you an ideal employee&mdash;and you want to show that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A response that focuses exclusively on perks and benefits to employees probably won&rsquo;t go over very well,&rdquo; Brady notes. &ldquo;It suggests you&rsquo;re only interested in what you get, rather than what you contribute to the corporate community.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Your answer should show you&rsquo;ve researched the company and the challenges it faces, Jennae says. In your ideal company, you will be part of the solution to those problems.</p>

<p><strong><em>You say:</em></strong><em> &ldquo;My ideal company would present exciting challenges that allow me to use my interest in and experience with growing sustainability efforts, and I see how my experience developing metrics could be useful here to propel the business forward&rdquo;</em></p>

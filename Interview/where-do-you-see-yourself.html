		<h1>How to answer, "Where do you see yourself in 5 years?"</h1>
        <h3>This is how you can answer the common interview question.</h3>
    	<div class="container-fluid">
 		<p>Nobody has a crystal ball, but that doesn&#39;t give you an excuse when it comes to predicting your future. When an interviewer asks you, &ldquo;Where do you see yourself in five years?&rdquo; they are&nbsp;testing your level of career ambition. Joseph Wessner, assistant general manager of Coughlin Printing Group in Watertown, New York, says despite its ambiguity, this question, when asked, does have a definitive answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can tell by your resume and cover letter if you have the skills</a> and education necessary to fill the position&mdash;that is why I am talking to you,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;What I need to know is, do you fit in with our company&rsquo;s team, vision, and culture</a>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>These guidelines will help you develop a winning answer to this common job interview question.</p>

<h2><strong>Explain how your goals align with the company&rsquo;s</strong></h2>

<p>You should&rsquo;ve already done your research on the company</a>, so you can easily pick out some points from the company&rsquo;s mission statement that resonate with you and your goals, and mention how you hope to expand on those in the coming years.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We want to know these people want to work and not outgrow us,&rdquo; says Curtis Boyd, co-founder and CEO of Future Solutions Media, a Los Angeles-based&nbsp;agency specializing in online reputation management. &ldquo;We want to know our employees are striving to grow within the company.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong><em>You say:</em></strong><em> &ldquo;I respect how this company develops its employees, and I hope that in five years, I&rsquo;ll be managing my own team and helping to expand my department.&rdquo;</em></p>

<h2><strong>Show the right amount of ambition</strong></h2>

<p>Employers want to know their employees have some desire to grow in their careers, says Helen Chalmers, a career counselor with Dallas-based Thoughtful Therapy. You can include an interest in management training or a desire to work your way into a specific position you have your eye on.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t go overboard, though. &ldquo;The temptation for job seekers is to be too ambitious about their plans,&rdquo; Wessner says. &ldquo;I do not want to hear about how you will be a CEO or working for my competition</a> in five years.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong><em>You say</em></strong><em>: &ldquo;I want to explore management training opportunities and also learn the finer points of this industry, so I can eventually become&nbsp;a company leader.&rdquo;</em></p>

<h2><strong>Show an interest in learning</strong></h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s face it:&nbsp;A&nbsp;lot of people don&rsquo;t know exactly what they want to be doing in five years, but you can always express a desire to learn and grow more in a certain area.</p>

<p>Talk about some aspect of your work life that you&rsquo;d like to improve. Maybe there&rsquo;s an area of the business you don&rsquo;t understand and would like to learn more about. Or, maybe there&rsquo;s a new language you&rsquo;d like to learn or a class you&rsquo;d like to take. Show them you&rsquo;re interested in knowing more than you do right now.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that this question can also offer a jumping off point for you to find out where others who started in this position five years ago are now, Chalmers says. &ldquo;Just make sure your tone of voice is conversational and curious.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong><em>You say</em></strong><em>: &ldquo;I hope to take an accounting class, so I can learn more about the financial aspects of this industry and gain a better understanding of how the business, as a whole,&nbsp;works. But actually, could you tell me where the last person who held this position ended up?&rdquo;</em></p>

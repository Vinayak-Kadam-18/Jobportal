		<h1>Why Should We Hire You? What to Say in Your Interview</h1>
        <h3>To get a job, you must position yourself as the answer to a proverbial question. This is how to match your experience with an employerâ€™s needs.</h3>
        	<div class="container-fluid">
        		<p>From the moment you enter the room for a job interview, the hiring manager is assessing one thing: Are you the best person for the job? And at some point during the interview, you can expect to be asked straight up, &ldquo;Why should we hire you?&rdquo; Answer correctly, and you&#39;ll pass a very important test.</p>

<p>Obviously, you can&rsquo;t respond, &ldquo;Because I need a job.&rdquo; Granted, it&rsquo;s a loaded question, says Los Angeles executive coach Libby Gill, &ldquo;but you need to ace it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Basically, your answer needs to demonstrate that you are the solution to the employer&rsquo;s problem (a vacancy on their team), and no other candidate could possibly do the job better than you.</p>

<p>So why <em>should</em> they choose you over anybody else? Take these steps to prepare a well-crafted response.</p>

<h2><strong>Focus on the employer&rsquo;s needs (not yours)</strong></h2>

<p>Though the question &ldquo;Why should we hire you&rdquo; seems like the focus is on you and your wants, it&rsquo;s really not. Your personal career goals</a> are certainly important, but this question is an opportunity to explain how you&rsquo;ll bring value to the company.</p>

<p>To prepare, research everything you can about the business&rsquo; agenda&mdash;read its website, social media, quarterly reports, company profiles on Monster</a>, press releases, and recent news stories about the company. What are their goals? Where do they see themselves headed in the future? How can your talents help get them there? (&ldquo;This company wants to be an industry leader in xyz. My background has given me valuable experience in that realm, and I have a lot of ideas as to how we can make that happen together.&rdquo;)</p>

<h2><strong>Reflect on the job itself</strong></h2>

<p>You can also learn a lot from a job posting, says Priscilla Claman, president of Career Strategies Incorporated. Most job descriptions</a> outline not only the job responsibilities and qualifications, but also what core skills are required to be successful in the position.</p>

<p>Tim Cole, owner at career coaching firm The Compass Alliance, says the best strategy is to target three to four skills and explain how you&rsquo;ve demonstrated them in the past. (&ldquo;I know that business acumen is one of the crucial skills for this position. Let me give you a few examples of how I&rsquo;ve applied this skill in my career thus far.&rdquo;)</p>

<p>Where possible, weave in language from the job posting, says Gill. &ldquo;You can use some of the company&rsquo;s buzzwords without sounding overly rehearsed,&rdquo; she advises.</p>

<h2><strong>Address cultural fit</strong></h2>

<p>About eight in 10 employers said they measure forcultural fit</a> when hiring job candidates, one survey by international development firm Cubiks found. Read: Part of your&nbsp;&ldquo;Why should we hire you&rdquo; answer should indicate why you&rsquo;ll be a good match for the company&rsquo;s environment. (&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t a traditional company, which is wonderful because I don&rsquo;t consider myself a traditional worker. Like you, I thrive on innovation.&rdquo;)</p>

<h2><strong>Avoid clich&eacute;s</strong></h2>

<p>Using trite words or phrases</a> to articulate your value is one of the biggest mistakes job candidates make, says Claman. Indeed, you&rsquo;re not going blow hiring managers away with your originality by using lines they&rsquo;ve heard over and over again. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t just sit there and say, &lsquo;Hire me because I&rsquo;m a hard worker,&rsquo; or &lsquo;I&rsquo;m self-motivated,&rsquo;&rdquo; Claman says.</p>

<p>Rather than <em>telling</em> an interviewer you&rsquo;re a self-starter, back it up with an anecdote that <em>shows</em> how you&rsquo;ve collaborated well with co-workers in the past. (&ldquo;I&#39;m a team player</a>. I know you&#39;ve probably heard that before, so let me give you an example.&rdquo;)</p>

<h2><strong>Don&rsquo;t hold back</strong></h2>

<p>To impress a hiring manager, you have to show confidence, says Julie Jansen, career coach and author of <em>You Want Me to Work With Who? </em>&ldquo;Employers like to see that you know what your strengths are and that you know you bring value,&rdquo; Jansen says.</p>

<p>Look at past performance reviews to see what managers praised you for and talk to former co-workers about your contributions&mdash;then highlight those skills or achievements. And, lead with a power statement: &ldquo;If you want someone who can walk in and start managing a project without a lot of direction, or someone who already has a black belt in this sector, then I&rsquo;m the person you should hire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Feeling fearless? Jansen recommends this unconventional response: &ldquo;If you want someone who will maintain status quo, then I&rsquo;m not the person you should hire.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><strong>Fit to be hired</strong></h2>

<p>Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s not enough to hear &quot;Why should we hire you?&quot; and then point to yourself and blurt out, &ldquo;Honestly, why wouldn&rsquo;t you want to hire this?&rdquo; There are better ways to make your point.

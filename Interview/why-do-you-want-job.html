		<h1>How to answer the interview question "Why do you want this job?"</h1>
        <h3>Give an honest answer that shows youâ€™ll get the job done and not be a buzzkill at happy hour</h3>
     <div class="container-fluid">
     	<p>When asked in an interview, &quot;Why do you want this job?&quot; you can answer using the following steps as a guide:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Show how your skills match;</li>
	<li>Show your enthusiasm for the job;</li>
	<li>And show how you fit into the culture.</li>
</ul>

<p>Peterson&#39;s&nbsp;answer illustrates what hiring managers really want to get when they pose this question: a sense of who you really as well as a sense of how you&rsquo;d fit and add value to the organization.</p>

<p>The three ingredients below will help you craft a perfect answer that will keep you in the game. Word to the wise: One thing you should <em>not</em> say in response to this question is &nbsp;&ldquo;Because I need a job.&rdquo; That shows&nbsp;a lack of passion, and suggests you might not stick around if something better comes along.</p>

<h2><strong>Show how your skills match</strong></h2>

<p>At every point of the interview, you need to show your skills and ability to solve problems</a> are a good fit for the company.</p>

<p>Go back to the job description and your earlier conversations with hiring managers to get a review what they&rsquo;re looking for and craft your answer around that.</p>

<p><em><strong>You say:</strong> &ldquo;You&rsquo;re looking for someone who can manage big software projects from across functions, and that&rsquo;s exactly what I was doing when I worked at Company X. I managed a budget of $2 million, and a cross-department teams of 10 people that included developers, engineers, and creatives to bring 15 software products to market.&rdquo;</em></p>

<h2><strong>Show your enthusiasm for the job</strong></h2>

<p>Your answer should show that you&rsquo;ll be able to use or learn key skills in the position that are important to you, says Dawn C. Reid, owner of Reid Ready Life Coaching in Clementon, New Jersey.</p>

<p>While the question seems to ask about what you want, remember that it&rsquo;s really about the employer. So even as you talk about what has you excited, put it into the context of how this will make you an asset to the organization.</p>

<p>Find a way to mention your long-term prospects at the company, and you can also quell the employer&rsquo;s concerns about retention or edge out another candidate who might be a flight risk.</p>

<p><em><strong>You say:</strong> &ldquo;I&rsquo;m excited to see there&rsquo;s a lot of opportunity to use advanced computer skills in this position. Being able to build my skills and continue to develop in a growing company is important to me, and there seems to be long-term opportunities here.&rdquo;</em></p>

<h2><strong>Show how you fit into the culture</strong></h2>

<p>The company isn&rsquo;t just interviewing you to find out about your skills. They want to know if you&rsquo;ll be a decent coworker. So your answer needs to prove that your goals and values are similar to the organization&rsquo;s, says A.P. Grow, associate professor of leadership at City University of Seattle.</p>

<p>Your research for the interview&mdash;grilling friends you know who work there and reading up on the latest news about the company&mdash;should give you a sense of the firm&rsquo;s mission and values. Find spots where they overlap with your story and present them in your answer.</p>

<p><em><strong>You say:</strong> &ldquo;This organization&#39;s priorities for ethics, teamwork and effectiveness match my own. What&#39;s most important to me is finding a place where individuals want to work together, as a true team. I see that reflected here. The match of what you need with what I can do is clear, and the additional benefit of having the same values and community interests lead me to want to be here more than anywhere else.&rdquo;</em></p>

<h2><strong><span>Know what to say ahead of time</span></strong></h2>

<p><span>If you&#39;re worried that you&#39;ll be&nbsp;a nervous wreck with a hiring manager staring at you and waiting for you to come up with smart answers to interview questions, know that&nbsp;it doesn&#39;t have to be that way. A little preparation can go a long way.
